# SQL, Python & ML Study

This repository contains my solutions and study notes for SQL, Python, and Machine Learning problems.

## Overview

I'm actively solving problems from two platforms on a weekly basis:

- **Stratascratch**: SQL and Python coding challenges
- **Deep-ML**: Machine Learning problems and exercises

Each week, I solve multiple problems and document my solutions with explanations and code.

## Repository Structure

```
├── stratascratch/     # Solutions for Stratascratch problems
│   └── week5.md       # Weekly problem sets
└── deep-ml/           # Solutions for Deep-ML problems
```

## Progress

- **Stratascratch**: Currently working on Week 5
- **Deep-ML**: Currently working on Week 5

## Notes

- Solutions include SQL/Python code, and explanations
- Each week's problems are organized in separate markdown files
